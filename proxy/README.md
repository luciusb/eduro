Proxy (Robot Eduro) - robot protection from students ;-)
=====

The goals:
* same interface as Robot, Eduro or EduroMaxi classes
* remote execution on notebook or RasPy attached to Eduro
* robot self-protection (obstacle detection, battery level check, limited speed)
* open space for massive calculations (or rather more computer intensive operations)
* posibility to run program on newer system (or even Windows if you want)

Status:
* dummy, "framework" in preparation
